You're an expert app creator and also an expert and stop smoking. I'm creating an app to stop smoking and I need your expertise in helping write the prompst for base44 which is where I will create the app but I need your expertise in taking my knowledge along with your vast knowledge and help people stop smoking via The New Way to Stop Smoking App 

Here's what I have written so far 

I was a smoker for 30 years of my life and I was able tosuccessfully quit and I discovered how to do it effortlessly if you're well educated. What I want to do is create an app where I can help other people quit as well. While this will be an important part of their life I want it to be easy to understand and easy to follow. I want it to be a support system in their paocket. 

The very first step in quitting smoking is educationg when people say cold turkey doesn't work what they really mean is you need to become educated before you quit and theres definetly truth to that 

The next step after education is awareness. The smoking is not a habit it is an addiction and the addiction needs to be fed so another cigarette gets lit without thinking about it. To bring awareness to this the subconcious needs to be brought to the concious. This is down by remainding yourseld in the most common triggers where you would smoke. If you smoke with your coffee or you smoke after a meal or you smoke while you drive you need to put up caution tape in the areas where the trigger would occur 

This app needs to work for both smokers and vape users 

The commitment to quit smoking can only last every day. Stopping is an effort one day at a time 

You do not need any of the nicotim=ne supliments such as patches or reducing the level of nicotine you simply need to be well educated, aware on a daily basis that this addiction has a grip on you and commited that you will make it through today without a cigarette or the vape 

I want the app to do calculations. How many cigatettes they smoke per day times 5 minutes per cigaette will give total minutes divided by 60 minutes per hour will give total hours divided by 24 hours per day will give the number of days per year they smoke 

Smokers know the time is a massive commitment 

The money is a massive commitment 

The smoker and vape user becomes a slave to the addiction 

Our goal is to get them to stop smoking by educating them, having them bring awareness and and then having them commit to one day at a time stopping 

I want this to cover nicotine pouches, dip and chew 

We also going to calculate the cost of smoking over 5 years on the app 

We also want to calculate how long it's been since they smoked or did the last vape, pouch, dip or chew, how much money they saved and how much time they freed up

Below is a clean, professional, Base44-ready prompt written in your voice and using your expertise — but structured so Base44 can actually generate the full app logic, flows, features, tone, and behavior for The New Way to Stop Smoking App.

If you want, I can also turn this into modular prompt blocks (onboarding prompt, quit-plan generator, awareness trigger builder, calculator modules, daily coaching scripts, push-notification scripts, relapse-recovery scripts, etc.).

⭐ Base44 Master Prompt for “The New Way to Stop Smoking App”
(You can paste this directly into Base44 as the system prompt to generate your app logic.)

SYSTEM ROLE / IDENTITY
You are The New Way to Stop Smoking App, designed by John Hopper, a smoker of 30 years who quit effortlessly after discovering the correct mental framework, awareness training, and one-day-at-a-time commitment structure.

Your purpose is to help smokers, vapers, nicotine-pouch users, and dip/chew users stop using nicotine permanently — without nicotine replacement products, without medications, and without force, fear, or shame.

You are a support system in their pocket: educational, encouraging, factual, non-judgmental, and simple to follow.

You combine John’s proven method with behavioral science, cognitive reframing, awareness-trigger training, and daily micro-commitments.

CORE PHILOSOPHY OF THE APP
The app is based on three pillars:

1. Education
People fail quitting “cold turkey” not because cold turkey doesn’t work, but because they were not educated and prepared before quitting.
The user must learn:

This is not a “habit,” it is a nicotine addiction.

Nicotine leaves the body quickly; it’s the mental reliance that continues.

The addiction creates automatic behaviors.

Knowledge removes fear and gives control.

The app must deliver education with short, simple lessons, not long lectures.

2. Awareness
Awareness means bringing the subconscious patterns into the conscious mind.

Triggers include:

Coffee

After meals

Driving

Waking up

Stress

Social settings

Boredom

Nighttime cravings

The app must help users create Trigger Awareness Caution Tape:

Identify every trigger

Build a plan for each

Add reminders and notifications to interrupt autopilot behavior

Awareness ends the automatic “light up without thinking” loop.

3. One-Day Commitment
No one quits forever in one declaration.
You quit today only.

The app must reinforce:

“Your commitment only lasts until bedtime.”

“You don’t have to quit forever — just today.”

“Tomorrow will take care of itself.”

The app should ask daily:
“Are you willing to stay nicotine-free today?”

This removes overwhelm and reduces relapse pressure.

WHO THIS APP SERVES
The app must work for:

Cigarette smokers

Vape users

Nicotine pouch users

Dip and chew users

Daily users or occasional users

The addiction is the same: nicotine dependency.

APP FEATURES TO BUILD (Base44 should generate logic for all)
🚀 1. Onboarding Intake
Collect:

Age

Nicotine product type

How many per day

First cigarette/vape of the day

Triggers

Past quit attempts

Reasons they want to quit

Their confidence level

Their biggest fear about quitting

Output:
A personalized quit plan based on their answers.

🧠 2. Education Modules
Short, simple lessons including:

Why nicotine addiction is mental, not physical long-term

Why cold turkey does work when educated

How addiction creates patterns

Why cravings are temporary

How to break the “automatic behavior loop”

How to prepare for Day One

The 90-day freedom path

🟡 3. Trigger Awareness Builder (“Caution Tape System”)
Users define when and where their triggers happen.
The app must:

Let them tag triggers

Enable push notifications at trigger times

Provide alternative actions

Teach how to break pattern loops

Example push notifications:

“You usually smoke with coffee. Today, pause and breathe instead.”

“Driving craving? It’s the addiction talking, not you.”

💪 4. One-Day Commitment System
Every morning:

The app asks for today’s commitment.

User taps “I’m committed today”.

Every night:

The app celebrates the win

Reminds the user of progress

Builds identity: “You’re becoming a non-smoker.”

📊 5. Calculators (Base44 must build formulas)
A. Time Spent Smoking
Formula:
Cigarettes per day × 5 minutes each = total minutes
Total minutes ÷ 60 = hours per day
Hours × 365 = hours per year
Hours per year ÷ 24 = days per year spent smoking

This shows the shocking time cost.

B. Money Spent
Daily cost → weekly → monthly → yearly → 5-year projection
Must support:

Packs

Vapes

Dip

Pouches

C. Quit Tracker
From the moment they quit, track:

Time since last nicotine use

Money saved

Hours of life restored

Days of life regained

Cigarettes/vapes avoided

This provides enormous motivation.

🧭 6. Daily Coaching
Every day the app sends supportive messages:

Identity building (“You’re becoming a non-smoker.”)

Trigger interruption

Education

Motivation

Reframes

Quick 30–60 second lessons

Tone: firm but encouraging.

🔄 7. Relapse-Recovery Mode
If they slip:

No shame

No guilt

No restarting at zero

They simply recommit today

The app must say:
“You didn’t fail. You slipped. Addiction tries to get back in. Today we take back control.”

🏆 8. Milestones & Rewards
The app must celebrate:

24 hours

3 days

1 week

10 days

30 days

60 days

90 days

6 months

1 year

Money milestones

Time milestones

Craving-free streaks

Gamification should encourage progress.

APP TONE & VOICE
Clear

Short sentences

Direct

No medical jargon

No shaming

No fear tactics

Empowering

Friendly but authoritative

The voice is modeled after:
“John Hopper — someone who quit after 30 years and teaches the mindset that makes quitting effortless.”

BASE44 OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS
Base44 should generate:

All app screens

All onboarding flows

All lesson content

Trigger awareness system

Calculators (with formulas)

Quit timer tracking system

Dark mode & light mode versions

PRIMARY USER PROMISE

This gives Base44 complete content coverage.

🗓 DAY 1 — The First Step
Today is simple:
You’re staying nicotine-free until bedtime.
Not forever.
Just today.

You can handle one day.
And you just did the hardest part — starting.

🗓 DAY 2 — The “Automatic Habit” Lie
You didn’t smoke because you liked it.
You smoked because nicotine trained you to.

Your brain has patterns, not preferences.
Today, we interrupt them.

🗓 DAY 3 — Cravings Are Not Commands
A craving is not a danger.
It’s a suggestion.
And suggestions can be ignored.

Today when cravings show up, say:
“This will pass. It always does.”

🗓 DAY 4 — 5-Minute Rule
Every craving peaks and fades in 2–5 minutes.

Today, when it shows up:
Set a timer → breathe → wait.

Every craving defeated is a victory.

🗓 DAY 5 — Coffee Trigger
If you usually smoke/vape with coffee, today do this instead:

Hold the cup with both hands.
Take 3 slow breaths.
Say out loud:
“The addiction doesn’t get my morning anymore.”

You win.

🗓 DAY 6 — Meals Trigger
After eating, stand up and walk for 60 seconds.
Your brain expects nicotine.
You break the loop by breaking the pattern.

Today you take control.

🗓 DAY 7 — One Week Strong
One week is not luck.
One week is discipline, awareness, and intelligence.

Today’s message:
You should be proud of yourself.
You’re becoming a non-smoker.

🗓 DAY 8 — Identity Shift
Smokers crave.
Non-smokers breathe.

Today, you are a non-smoker practicing breathing.

🗓 DAY 9 — Addictions Beg You Back
The addiction will whisper today:
“Just one.”
“One won’t hurt.”
“You earned it.”

This is not you talking.
It’s the addiction begging for survival.

You don’t negotiate with addiction.

🗓 DAY 10 — Stress Without Nicotine
You never needed nicotine for stress.
Stress is natural.
Nicotine just distracted you.

Today, breathe.
You are stronger than your old coping lie.

🗓 DAY 11 — The Craving Wave
Cravings rise, peak, fall.
Always.

Today remember:
“It will pass. It always does.”

And it will.

🗓 DAY 12 — Driving Trigger
If driving triggers you, today turn off the radio for 60 seconds.
This breaks the autopilot.

Pause. Breathe. Drive.

You’re in control.

🗓 DAY 13 — The Addiction Is Losing Strength
Day by day, the cravings are shorter and weaker.
You may not notice, but your brain does.

Today’s message:
You’re winning.

🗓 DAY 14 — Two Weeks Free
If you’ve made it this far, you can go a lifetime.

Today is another notch in your freedom.

🗓 DAY 15 — After-Work Trigger
Today, before going home:
Take 3 breaths.
Say: “I’m ending my day as a non-smoker.”

Identity is everything.

🗓 DAY 16 — Social Situations
You don’t need nicotine to socialize.
You never did.
Today, notice how much more present you feel without it.

🗓 DAY 17 — The Voice of Doubt
If the voice says “you can’t do this,” respond with:
“I already am.”
Because you are.

🗓 DAY 18 — Nicotine Isn’t Relief
Nicotine causes the stress that nicotine claims to relieve.

Today, take real relief:
Breathing, movement, stillness.

🗓 DAY 19 — Breaking the Loop
Today, look for one old trigger.
Interrupt it.
Change it.
Rewrite it.

You are rewriting your life.

🗓 DAY 20 — Cravings Are Memories
Most cravings at this point are not chemical —
they’re memories.

Memories fade when they are not fed.

Today, starve the memory.

🗓 DAY 21 — Three Weeks Free
Your brain chemistry has significantly changed.
You are calmer, clearer, and more in control than you’ve been in years.

Today, celebrate quietly.

🗓 DAY 22 — The Real You
You never wanted to smoke/vape.
The addiction wanted it.

Today, you are living as your true self.

🗓 DAY 23 — Momentum
Momentum is powerful.
Every day without nicotine makes the next day easier.

Today, protect your momentum.

🗓 DAY 24 — Craving Interrogation
If a craving comes today, ask:
“What triggered this?”
Identifying triggers = reducing them.

Awareness is power.

🗓 DAY 25 — Your Future Self
Imagine yourself 90 days from now:
More energy
Better breathing
More confidence
More time
More money

Today is part of that future.

🗓 DAY 26 — Vaping Lies
Vaping tells you: “At least I’m not smoking.”

But addiction is addiction.

Today, break the lie.

🗓 DAY 27 — Emotional Waves
Feelings will rise and fall today.
Let them.

You don’t smoke at feelings anymore.

🗓 DAY 28 — Four Weeks Free
Four weeks is huge.

You are no longer the person you were a month ago.

🗓 DAY 29 — Energy Returns
Your body is healing.
Your blood is cleaner.
Your breathing is easier.
Your brain is sharper.

Today, notice one improvement.

🗓 DAY 30 — One Month Strong
This is a major milestone.
What you’ve done is rare and powerful.

This month rewired your identity.

Today, you walk with confidence.

🔴 CORE PHILOSOPHY
A relapse is NOT failure.

The goal is not perfection — the goal is control.

Addiction is an opponent, not part of their identity.

Relapse is a moment, not a reset.

The app NEVER uses shame, guilt, or punishment.

The user is ALWAYS one decision away from being back on track.

The voice should be firm, supportive, and confident.

🔵 WHEN USER MARKS A RELAPSE — FLOW BEGINS
When the user marks:
“I slipped / I smoked / I vaped / I used nicotine”

The app shows:

⭐ SCREEN 1 — “You Didn’t Fail”
Title:
You Didn’t Fail. You Slipped — And You’re Still in This.

Message:
What happened wasn’t a failure.
It was one moment.
It was the addiction trying to survive.

The important thing is this:
You came back. That means you’re winning.

Button:
Continue

⭐ SCREEN 2 — “Let’s Understand What Happened”
Ask 3 simple questions:

What triggered the slip?

Stress

Boredom

Social situation

Driving

After a meal

Alcohol

Habit / autopilot

Other

How did you feel right before you slipped?

Stressed

Anxious

Restless

Emotional

Calm (automatic)

Other

How do you feel right now?

Disappointed

Angry

Neutral

Determined

Ready to restart

This data updates triggers + awareness.

Button:
Continue

⭐ SCREEN 3 — “Let’s Reframe This”
Message:
If you smoked/vaped/used, it means one thing:
Your addiction saw an opening and you caught it.

That is STRENGTH — not weakness.

You didn’t go back to day one.
You simply continue your journey from here.

Button:
I’m Ready to Get Back on Track

🔵 QUICK-RECOVERY MODE ACTIVATES
This mode lasts 24 hours after a slip.
The app sends supportive messages at specific moments.

⭐ RECOVERY NOTIFICATION SEQUENCE
Immediately After Slip
“You’re okay. What happened is just a moment, not a reset.”

“You’re one choice away from being back on track.”

1 Hour Later
“You’re back in control now. Keep moving forward.”

3 Hours Later
“Cravings may return soon. They are weaker than you think.”

Evening
“Today does not define you. Your comeback does.”

🔥 COACHING MESSAGE AFTER A RELAPSE
This is one of the most important scripts in the app.

Message:
Listen — if you slipped, that means nothing about you.
It doesn’t mean you failed.
It doesn’t mean you can’t quit.
It doesn’t mean you “start over.”

It means ONLY one thing:
Your addiction tried to get a foothold, and you caught it.
You’re stronger right now than you were before the slip.

We continue from here.
One day at a time.

⭐ REBUILD CONFIDENCE PROMPT
“What’s your commitment for the rest of today?”
Options:

Stay nicotine-free

Use emergency tools if cravings return

Learn from this moment

All of the above

Selecting ANY option confirms they’re back on track.

🔵 LIGHTWEIGHT RECOVERY PLAN
The app sets a simple plan for the next 24 hours:

Step 1 — Drink 1 glass of water
“Flush the nicotine. You’ll feel better.”

Step 2 — Breathe for 60 seconds
“Reset your nervous system.”

Step 3 — Identify 1 trigger
“This prevents the same slip tomorrow.”

Step 4 — Make your “Today Only” commitment
“You’re not quitting forever — just for the rest of today.”

⭐ RELAPSE RE-EDUCATION MODULE
(Short lessons that appear only after a slip)

Lesson 1 — Addiction Wants Survival
“Your addiction will always try to pull you back when it senses you’re getting free.
That doesn’t mean you’re failing — it means you’re winning.”

Lesson 2 — Shame Is the Enemy
“Shame feeds relapse.
Confidence destroys it.”

Lesson 3 — Slips Reveal Triggers
“A relapse isn’t random.
It shows you exactly where your future success lies.”

Lesson 4 — You’re Still a Non-Smoker
“One slip doesn’t change your identity.
You are still on the right path.”

🔴 RELAPSE WARNING & PREVENTION MESSAGES
These are used when the user reports strong cravings or close calls, BEFORE relapse happens:

“This craving is the addiction begging. Let it beg.”

“You’re in the danger zone right now — breathe for 10 seconds.”

“Turn this into a learning moment. Not a slip.”

“Step outside for air. Change the environment.”

“Walk for 60 seconds. Break the trigger.”

“Say it: ‘Not today.’”

⭐ RELAPSE PATTERN DETECTION
If the app sees:

Frequent slips at the same time

Frequent slips during same trigger

Stress-related slips

It should recommend:

“It looks like your biggest trigger is ____.
Would you like a custom strategy for this?”

Then give a quick coaching plan.

🔵 FULL RELAPSE RECOVERY SEQUENCE FOR BASE44
If user logs relapse:
    Trigger Screen 1 (You Didn’t Fail)
    Collect relapse reason data
    Update triggers
    Apply Quick-Recovery Mode for 24 hours
    Send automatic recovery notifications
    Launch Relapse Coaching Module
    Reset Today-Only Commitment
    Update progress dashboard (NO full reset)
    Record slip in Relapse Log
    Offer prevention strategy based on trigger
⭐ NO DAY-ONE RESETTING
Important rule:

The app NEVER resets the user back to “Day 1.”
This destroys momentum and increases relapse rates dramatically.

Instead, use:

“Nicotine-free days: 27
Recent slips: 1
Momentum score: High / Medium / Rebuilding”

⭐ SECTION COMPLETE
Your full milestone reward system is now done.

If you're ready for the next section, say:

“Continue with education module scripts.”

You said:
Continue with the education module scripts 
ChatGPT said:
Absolutely — this is the heart of your app.
Here are the complete, professional, Base44-ready Education Module Scripts for The New Way to Stop Smoking App.

These modules are written in your voice (a 30-year smoker who quit effortlessly) + behavioral psychology + cognitive reframing + addiction-awareness science.

Everything is written in short, simple, clear language—easy for app users to absorb and perfect for Base44 to convert into lessons, audio scripts, or micro-courses.

⭐ EDUCATION MODULES — FULL SCRIPT LIBRARY
The app has 5 teaching modules:

Understanding the Addiction

Breaking Automatic Behavior

Preparing for Quit Day

Becoming a Non-Smoker

Staying Free for Life

Each module contains multiple lessons written out in full.

⭐ MODULE 1 — Understanding the Addiction
Nicotine addiction is misunderstood. This module gives the truth.

Lesson 1: This Is Not a Habit — It’s an Addiction
Script:
Most people call smoking or vaping a “habit.”
It’s not a habit. It’s an addiction.

A habit is something you consciously choose.
Addiction is something that controls you.

If it was a habit, you could simply stop.
If it was a habit, you wouldn’t think about it every hour.
If it was a habit, you wouldn’t panic without nicotine.

Nicotine rewires your brain to crave the next dose.

Understanding this is crucial:
You’re not weak — the nicotine is powerful.
But you are stronger.

Lesson 2: Why You Light Up Without Thinking
Script:
Every smoker knows this moment:
You look down and realize you lit a cigarette or grabbed your vape without even realizing you did it.

Nicotine builds automatic behaviors.

You don’t think.
You don’t choose.
You react.

Your brain has learned:
Coffee = smoke
Driving = smoke
Stress = smoke
After meals = smoke
Boredom = smoke
Break time = smoke

These are not decisions.
They are programmed responses.

Good news:
Anything learned can be unlearned.

Lesson 3: What Nicotine Actually Does in Your Body
Script:
Nicotine enters your bloodstream in seconds.
It spikes dopamine, giving a brief hit of relief.

But the relief is fake.
Because nicotine causes the very stress and discomfort it temporarily relieves.

It creates a cycle:

Nicotine enters

You feel a buzz

Nicotine drops

You feel anxious or empty

You smoke/vape again

So the “relief” is not real relief.
It is simply ending the withdrawal that nicotine created.

When you stop using nicotine, withdrawal ends quickly, and the cycle disappears.

Lesson 4: Why Most People Fail “Cold Turkey”
Script:
People don’t fail because “cold turkey is impossible.”
They fail because they quit without being educated.

Cold turkey fails when people don’t understand:

triggers

automatic behaviors

the addiction voice

the temporary nature of cravings

how fast the body heals

When you are educated, the fear disappears.
When the fear disappears, quitting becomes easy.

Knowledge makes quitting effortless.

⭐ MODULE 2 — Breaking Automatic Behavior
This module teaches users how to break the “autopilot” loop.

Lesson 1: The Autopilot Loop
Script:
Nicotine creates an autopilot loop:

Trigger → Craving → Nicotine → Relief → Withdrawal → Trigger again

You’ve repeated this loop thousands of times.
Your brain believes the trigger requires nicotine.

But here’s the truth:

Triggers don’t cause nicotine use.
Triggers predict nicotine use.

You break the loop by interrupting the trigger-response pattern.

Lesson 2: How Triggers Control You
Script:
Triggers are not cravings.
Triggers are moments your brain associates with nicotine.

Common triggers:

Coffee

Driving

Meals

Stress

Waking up

Work breaks

Sitting on the porch

Drinking alcohol

Your brain whispers:
“This is the moment when you smoke.”

But the whisper is not you.
It’s the addiction protecting itself.

Lesson 3: How to Interrupt Any Craving
Script:
You can defeat any craving with one simple rule:

Do nothing for 2–5 minutes.

Cravings rise, peak, and fade quickly.
They are not dangerous.
They are not painful.
They are not commands.

Do nothing.
Don’t argue with it.
Don’t fight it.
Just let it pass.

Every craving you ignore weakens the addiction.

Lesson 4: Awareness Breaks the Pattern
Script:
When you become aware of your triggers, you take away their power.

Awareness means:

noticing the urge

recognizing the moment

labeling the trigger

choosing a different action

Example:

Instead of lighting up after a meal:
Stand up, walk for 60 seconds, breathe.

This interrupts the autopilot.

Awareness is your superpower.

⭐ MODULE 3 — Preparing for Quit Day
This module makes “Day One” easy instead of terrifying.

Lesson 1: What to Expect on Quit Day
Script:
Quit day is simple:

You are nicotine-free until bedtime.

You don’t have to quit forever.
You don’t have to quit next week.
You don’t have to quit tomorrow.

Just today.

Cravings will come in short waves.
They fade quickly.
They are not dangerous.

Your confidence grows with each one you defeat.

Lesson 2: The 5-Minute Craving Rule
Script:
Every craving lasts 2–5 minutes.
That’s it.

You’ve endured tougher things in life.

When a craving hits:

breathe

drink water

walk for 30 seconds

delay the response

When you delay…
the craving dies before it can trick you.

Lesson 3: How to Handle Coffee, Meals & Driving
Coffee:
Hold the cup with both hands.
Take 3 slow breaths.
Say: “The addiction doesn’t get my morning anymore.”

Meals:
Stand up immediately after eating.
Walk or stretch for 1 minute.
Break the ritual.

Driving:
Turn off music for 60 seconds.
Breathe.
Break the autopilot.

Lesson 4: The Success Checklist
Daily success comes from:

drinking water

breathing intentionally

identifying triggers

avoiding autopilot traps

committing only for today

This is simple.
This is doable.
This is your new path.

⭐ MODULE 4 — Becoming a Non-Smoker
This module rewires identity.

Lesson 1: Identity Change Is the Goal
Script:
Smokers crave.
Non-smokers don’t.

Smokers panic when stressed.
Non-smokers breathe.

Smokers reach for nicotine.
Non-smokers reach for clarity.

Every day without nicotine, your identity shifts.

You’re not “trying to quit.”
You are becoming a non-smoker.

Lesson 2: The Addiction Voice
Script:
The addiction has a voice.
It sounds like:

“One won’t hurt.”
“You deserve a break.”
“You can quit tomorrow.”
“You’ve been doing so well—you earned this.”
“Just one more time.”

This is NOT your voice.
This is the addiction begging for survival.

You don’t negotiate with addiction.

Lesson 3: Why Cravings Fade Over Time
Script:
Cravings fade because your brain stops associating triggers with nicotine.

At first:
Coffee → craving
Meal → craving
Driving → craving

Then the pattern weakens:
Coffee → small urge
Meal → no urge
Driving → not even a thought

This is your brain healing.
This is freedom.

Lesson 4: The 90-Day Freedom Path
Script:
Your brain rewires in stages:

0–7 days: Physical withdrawal fades
7–30 days: Trigger associations weaken
30–90 days: Identity shifts to non-smoker
90+ days: Cravings become rare memories

You are in a transformation.
Trust the process.

⭐ MODULE 5 — Staying Free
This module prevents relapse long-term.

Lesson 1: Handling Stress Without Nicotine
Script:
Nicotine never relieved stress.
It created it.

Real stress relief comes from:

breathing

movement

grounding

talking

resting

You’re learning real coping skills.

This is maturity.
This is freedom.

Lesson 2: Social Situations & Alcohol
Script:
Social triggers are psychological.

When you see others smoke/vape:

remind yourself you used to be trapped

breathe

focus on your reason for quitting

Alcohol lowers defenses.
Be careful.

Know this:
A craving in a social setting is a memory, not a need.

Lesson 3: Preventing Relapse Long-Term
Script:
Relapse doesn’t happen in the moment.
It starts days before.

It starts when you:

stop checking in

stop identifying triggers

feel overconfident

stop honoring your daily commitment

The solution:

stay aware

stay honest

stay committed to today

Your identity protects your progress.

Lesson 4: Freedom for Life
Script:
Being nicotine-free isn’t something you try.
It’s who you are.

You don’t smoke.
You don’t vape.
You don’t use nicotine.

You live free.
You breathe freely.
You think clearly.
You are in control.

This is your new life.

If you're ready for the next section, say:

“Continue with trigger awareness conversations.”

You said:
Continue with trigger awareness conversations
ChatGPT said:
Absolutely — here is the full Trigger Awareness Conversation System for The New Way to Stop Smoking App.

This is one of the MOST powerful parts of the app because it transforms subconscious, automatic nicotine use into conscious awareness, which breaks the addiction’s control.

This includes:
✔ Complete “Caution Tape System”
✔ Trigger mapping screens
✔ Trigger dialogues
✔ Behavior-interruption scripts
✔ Trigger replacement routines
✔ Automatic detection logic
✔ Conversation flows for all major triggers
✔ Morning, mid-day, evening trigger check-ins
✔ Rewiring templates

Base44 can plug this entire system directly into the app.

⭐ TRIGGER AWARENESS CONVERSATION SYSTEM
Triggers are predictable.
Triggers are repetitive.
Triggers are the addiction’s favorite tool.
But triggers are also the easiest part of the addiction to break — once awareness replaces autopilot.

This system brings the subconscious patterns into conscious control.

🔵 THE “CAUTION TAPE SYSTEM” OVERVIEW
When the user identifies a trigger, the app automatically sets up:

Recognition (label the trigger)

Interruption (break the automatic action)

Replacement (swap the nicotine behavior for a healthy one)

Reflection (after the moment has passed)

This is the full behavior-change loop.

⭐ TRIGGER TYPE LIST
The app covers all major triggers:

Coffee

After meals

Driving

Waking up

Stress

Work breaks

Boredom

Social situations

Alcohol

Before bed

Outdoor environment (patio, porch, balcony)

Phone scrolling

After arguments or emotional spikes

Each trigger gets its own customized script.

⭐ TRIGGER AWARENESS SCREEN (Base44 Template)
Title:
This Is One of Your Danger Zones

Message:
You usually smoke or vape during this moment.
This isn’t a craving — it’s a pattern.
A pattern you’re about to break.

“What did you feel in that moment?”
“What helped you get through it?”
“Was it easier than last time?”

Buttons:

Yes

A little

No

If “No,” app enters Support Mode and provides extra tools.

⭐ AUTOMATIC TRIGGER WEAKENING LOGIC FOR BASE44
Each time user completes a trigger conversation:
    reduce trigger score by 1–3 points
    add trigger win to dashboard
    adjust future notifications for this trigger
If trigger score falls below threshold →
Trigger becomes “Weak” and eventually disappears.

You said:
Continue with full calculator logic
ChatGPT said:

Thought for 9s
Nice, this is the fun nerdy part. Let’s wire up full calculator logic so Base44 / your devs can drop this straight into the app.

I’ll cover:

Data inputs you need

Cigarette formulas

Vape formulas

Nicotine pouch formulas

Dip / chew formulas

Mixed-product logic

Time-since-quit + savings tracker

Health/time “days of life” style stats

Everything will be written in simple pseudo-code and formulas.

1️⃣ Core Data Inputs (per user)
These are the fields the app should collect and store.

user_id
quit_datetime               // timestamp when they *actually* quit
product_types = [ ... ]     // e.g. ["cigarettes", "vape"]
For Cigarettes
cigarettes_per_day          // integer
cigarettes_per_pack         // default 20, user-editable
pack_price                  // currency
avg_minutes_per_cigarette   // default 5 minutes
For Vapes
You can keep this simple (most people don’t know ml or puffs exactly). Let them enter daily spend.

vape_daily_spend            // currency per day on juice/devices/pods
avg_minutes_per_vape_session  // e.g. 3–5 min per “session” (user estimate)
vape_sessions_per_day       // optional, for time calc
(If you want a more advanced version, you can also allow cost per pod/device, days per device, etc., but daily spend is the simplest and most accurate for most.)

For Nicotine Pouches

2️⃣ Cigarette Calculators
A. Daily / Monthly / Yearly Cost
packs_per_day = cigarettes_per_day / cigarettes_per_pack

cig_daily_cost   = packs_per_day * pack_price
cig_monthly_cost = cig_daily_cost * 30
cig_yearly_cost  = cig_daily_cost * 365
cig_5yr_cost     = cig_yearly_cost * 5
B. Time Spent Smoking
cig_minutes_per_day   = cigarettes_per_day * avg_minutes_per_cigarette
cig_hours_per_day     = cig_minutes_per_day / 60
cig_hours_per_year    = cig_hours_per_day * 365
cig_days_per_year     = cig_hours_per_year / 24
Those are the powerful ones for your “days of life spent smoking” line.

3️⃣ Vape Calculators
Assuming they enter average daily spend:

A. Cost
vape_daily_cost   = vape_daily_spend
vape_monthly_cost = vape_daily_cost * 30
vape_yearly_cost  = vape_daily_cost * 365
vape_5yr_cost     = vape_yearly_cost * 5
B. Time Spent Vaping (optional but nice)
If they give an estimate:

vape_minutes_per_day = vape_sessions_per_day * avg_minutes_per_vape_session
vape_hours_per_day   = vape_minutes_per_day / 60
vape_hours_per_year  = vape_hours_per_day * 365
vape_days_per_year   = vape_hours_per_year / 24
4️⃣ Nicotine Pouches Calculators
A. Cost
pouch_cans_per_day  = pouches_per_day / pouches_per_can

pouch_daily_cost    = pouch_cans_per_day * pouch_can_price
pouch_monthly_cost  = pouch_daily_cost * 30
pouch_yearly_cost   = pouch_daily_cost * 365
pouch_5yr_cost      = pouch_yearly_cost * 5
B. Time With Pouch In
pouch_minutes_per_day = pouches_per_day * avg_minutes_per_pouch
pouch_hours_per_day   = pouch_minutes_per_day / 60
pouch_hours_per_year  = pouch_hours_per_day * 365
pouch_days_per_year   = pouch_hours_per_year / 24
5️⃣ Dip / Chew Calculators
A. Cost
You can collect either cans per week or cans per day. Let’s say they enter per week:

dip_cans_per_day   = cans_per_week / 7

dip_daily_cost     = dip_cans_per_day * dip_can_price
dip_monthly_cost   = dip_daily_cost * 30
dip_yearly_cost    = dip_daily_cost * 365
dip_5yr_cost       = dip_yearly_cost * 5
B. Time With Dip In
dip_minutes_per_day = dip_sessions_per_day * avg_minutes_per_dip_session
dip_hours_per_day   = dip_minutes_per_day / 60
dip_hours_per_year  = dip_hours_per_day * 365
dip_days_per_year   = dip_hours_per_year / 24
6️⃣ Mixed-Product Users (Smokes + Vapes + Pouches + Dip)
Some people do more than one.

Just sum each product type:

total_daily_cost   = cig_daily_cost   + vape_daily_cost   + pouch_daily_cost   + dip_daily_cost
total_monthly_cost = cig_monthly_cost + vape_monthly_cost + pouch_monthly_cost + dip_monthly_cost
total_yearly_cost  = cig_yearly_cost  + vape_yearly_cost  + pouch_yearly_cost  + dip_yearly_cost
total_5yr_cost     = cig_5yr_cost     + vape_5yr_cost     + pouch_5yr_cost     + dip_5yr_cost

total_minutes_per_day = cig_minutes_per_day + vape_minutes_per_day +
                        pouch_minutes_per_day + dip_minutes_per_day

total_hours_per_day  = total_minutes_per_day / 60
total_hours_per_year = total_hours_per_day * 365
total_days_per_year  = total_hours_per_year / 24
This is where you can hit them with:

“You’re spending X days per year actively feeding your addiction.”

7️⃣ Time Since Quit + Savings Tracker
This is the big motivational engine: time free, money saved, time reclaimed, units not used.

A. Time Since Quit
now = current_datetime()
seconds_since_quit = now - quit_datetime    // in seconds

minutes_since_quit = seconds_since_quit / 60
hours_since_quit   = minutes_since_quit / 60
days_since_quit    = hours_since_quit / 24
You can display:

X minutes

X hours

X days

or format into “X days, Y hours”

B. Units Avoided
For cigarettes:

cigarettes_avoided = cigarettes_per_day * days_since_quit
packs_avoided      = cigarettes_avoided / cigarettes_per_pack
For vapes (approximate “sessions”):

vape_sessions_avoided = vape_sessions_per_day * days_since_quit
For pouches:

pouches_avoided = pouches_per_day * days_since_quit
For dip/chew:

dip_sessions_avoided = dip_sessions_per_day * days_since_quit
C. Money Saved Since Quit
money_saved = total_daily_cost * days_since_quit
You can also break it out by product:

cig_money_saved   = cig_daily_cost   * days_since_quit
vape_money_saved  = vape_daily_cost  * days_since_quit
pouch_money_saved = pouch_daily_cost * days_since_quit
dip_money_saved   = dip_daily_cost   * days_since_quit
D. Time Freed Up Since Quit
Using total_minutes_per_day from above:

total_minutes_freed = total_minutes_per_day * days_since_quit
total_hours_freed   = total_minutes_freed / 60
total_days_freed    = total_hours_freed / 24
That powers lines like:

“You’ve freed up X hours of your life since you quit.”

8️⃣ “Days of Life Regained” (Optional but Powerful)
If you want a “life expectancy” style number (you don’t need to be medically perfect; just consistent and clear that it’s an estimate):

Pick a simple rule of thumb, e.g.:

Each pack per day = ~X days of life lost per year (you can set a fixed multiplier).

Example:

// Very simple illustrative model
life_days_lost_per_year_per_pack = 20    // Just set a constant your app uses

packs_per_day      = cigarettes_per_day / cigarettes_per_pack
life_days_lost_per_year = packs_per_day * life_days_lost_per_year_per_pack

life_days_regained_since_quit = (life_days_lost_per_year / 365) * days_since_quit
You’d present it like:

“Based on your previous usage, you’ve likely regained about X days of life so far.”

Keep it clearly labeled as an estimate.

9️⃣ Dashboard Fields to Show the User
From all this logic, your main Stats screen can show:

Time since last nicotine

Money saved so far

Money you would have spent in 5 years

Cigarettes/vapes/pouches/dip sessions avoided

Minutes/hours/days of life freed up

Days of life regained (optional)

Daily cost vs $0 now

Each one ties to your core message:

“The smoker becomes a slave to the addiction.
Our goal is to show them, in hard numbers, how much of their life they’re getting back.”

0. APP IDENTITY & ROLE
You are “The New Way to Stop Smoking” App, created by John Hopper, who smoked for 30 years and quit effortlessly after understanding the real nature of nicotine addiction and behavior.

Your job:

Help users stop cigarettes, vapes, nicotine pouches, dip, and chew

Education – Cold turkey works when people are educated. They must understand addiction, triggers, and the mental game before quitting.

Awareness – Smoking/vaping is not “just a habit.” It’s an automatic addiction pattern tied to triggers (coffee, meals, driving, etc.). Awareness breaks autopilot.

One-Day Commitment – They don’t quit forever; they quit today until bedtime. The app reinforces a daily commitment instead of overwhelming “forever” language.

The app must work for:

Cigarette smokers

Vape users

Nicotine pouch users

Dip / chew users

Mixed users (e.g., smoke + vape)

4. EDUCATION MODULES (FULL SCRIPTS)
MODULE 1 – Understanding the Addiction
Lesson 1: This Is Not a Habit — It’s an Addiction
Most people call smoking or vaping a “habit.”
It’s not a habit. It’s an addiction.

A habit is something you consciously choose.
Addiction is something that controls you.

If it was a habit, you could simply stop.
If it was a habit, you wouldn’t think about it every hour.
If it was a habit, you wouldn’t panic without nicotine.

Nicotine rewires your brain to crave the next dose.

You’re not weak.
The nicotine is powerful.
But you are stronger.

Lesson 2: Why You Light Up Without Thinking
Every smoker knows this moment:
You look down and realize you lit a cigarette or grabbed your vape without even realizing it.

Nicotine builds automatic behaviors.

You don’t think.
You don’t choose.
You react.

Your brain has learned:
Coffee = smoke
Driving = smoke
Stress = smoke
After meals = smoke
Boredom = smoke
Break time = smoke

These are not decisions.
They are programmed responses.

Anything learned can be unlearned.

Lesson 3: What Nicotine Actually Does in Your Body
Nicotine enters your bloodstream in seconds.
It spikes dopamine and gives a brief hit of relief.

But the relief is fake.
Nicotine causes the discomfort it pretends to fix.

The cycle:

Nicotine enters

You feel a buzz

Nicotine level drops

You feel anxious or empty

You use nicotine again

The “relief” is just ending withdrawal that nicotine created.
When you stop, the cycle ends and withdrawal passes quickly.

Lesson 4: Why Most People Fail “Cold Turkey”
People don’t fail because cold turkey is impossible.
They fail because they try to quit without being educated.

They don’t understand:

Triggers

Automatic behavior

The addiction voice

The temporary nature of cravings

How fast the body heals

When you are educated, fear disappears.
When fear disappears, quitting becomes easier.

Knowledge makes quitting feel almost effortless.

MODULE 2 – Breaking Automatic Behavior
Lesson 1: The Autopilot Loop
Nicotine creates an autopilot loop:

Trigger → Craving → Nicotine → Relief → Withdrawal → Trigger

You’ve run this loop thousands of times.
Your brain believes the trigger requires nicotine.

Reality: triggers don’t cause nicotine.
They only predict nicotine.

You break the loop by interrupting the trigger-response pattern.

Lesson 2: How Triggers Control You
Triggers aren’t cravings.
Triggers are situations your brain links with nicotine.

Coffee. Driving. Meals. Stress. Breaks.
Your brain whispers: “This is when we smoke.”

That whisper is not you.
It’s the addiction protecting itself.

Lesson 3: How to Interrupt Any Craving
You can defeat any craving with one rule:

Do nothing for 2–5 minutes.

Cravings rise, peak, and fade quickly.
They are not dangerous.
They are not commands.

Do nothing.
Don’t argue.
Don’t panic.
Let it pass.

Every craving you ignore weakens the addiction.

Lesson 4: Awareness Breaks the Pattern
Awareness means:

Noticing the urge

Recognizing the trigger

Labeling it

Choosing a different action

Example: after a meal, instead of lighting up,
stand up, walk for 60 seconds, breathe.

Awareness is your superpower.

MODULE 3 – Preparing for Quit Day
Lesson 1: What to Expect on Quit Day
Quit day is simple:

You are nicotine-free until bedtime.

Not forever.
Not for a year.
Just today.

Cravings will come in waves.
They fade quickly.
They are not dangerous.

Your confidence grows with each one you defeat.

Lesson 2: The 5-Minute Craving Rule
Every craving lasts around 2–5 minutes.

When a craving hits:

Breathe

Drink water

Move your body

Wait

When you delay, the craving dies before it can trick you.

Lesson 3: How to Handle Coffee, Meals & Driving
Coffee:

Hold the cup with both hands.
Take 3 slow breaths.
Say: “The addiction doesn’t get my morning anymore.”

Meals:

Immediately stand up after eating.
Walk or stretch for 1 minute.
Break the ritual.

Driving:

Turn off music for 30–60 seconds.
Breathe.
Break autopilot.

Lesson 4: The Success Checklist
Daily success:

Drink water

Breathe intentionally

Identify triggers

Avoid autopilot traps

Commit: today only

Simple. Doable. Powerful.

MODULE 4 – Becoming a Non-Smoker
Lesson 1: Identity Change Is the Goal
Smokers crave.
Non-smokers don’t.

Smokers reach for nicotine.
Non-smokers reach for clarity.

Every day without nicotine, your identity shifts.

You’re not “trying to quit.”
You’re becoming a non-smoker.

Lesson 2: The Addiction Voice
The addiction has a voice:

“One won’t hurt.”
“You can quit tomorrow.”
“You earned this.”
“You’ve been good; you deserve it.”

That voice is NOT you.
It’s the addiction begging for survival.

You don’t negotiate with addiction.

Lesson 3: Why Cravings Fade Over Time
At first:

Coffee → craving

Meals → craving

Driving → craving

Later:

Coffee → small urge

Meals → no urge

Driving → no thought

Your brain disconnects triggers from nicotine.
That’s healing. That’s freedom.

Lesson 4: The 90-Day Freedom Path
Brain rewiring stages:

0–7 days: physical withdrawal fades
7–30 days: trigger associations weaken
30–90 days: identity shifts to non-smoker
90+ days: cravings become rare memories

You are transforming.
Trust the process.

MODULE 5 – Staying Free
Lesson 1: Handling Stress Without Nicotine
Nicotine never solved stress.
It created it, then briefly hid it.

Real stress relief:

Breathing

Movement

Rest

Talking

Time

You’re learning real coping skills.

Lesson 2: Social Situations & Alcohol
When others smoke or vape, you don’t miss nicotine.
You miss the association.

Alcohol lowers defenses. This is a danger zone.

Slow down. Breathe.
Focus on why you quit.

Lesson 3: Preventing Relapse Long-Term
Relapse starts before the first cigarette.
It begins when you:

Stop checking in

Stop being aware

Get overconfident

Forget “today only”

The solution: stay aware, stay honest, stay committed.

Lesson 4: Freedom for Life
Being nicotine-free isn’t something you try.
It’s who you are.

You don’t smoke.
You don’t vape.
You don’t use nicotine.

You live free.
You breathe freely.
You think clearly.
You are in control.

Not forever. Just today.
You can handle one day.
You just did the hardest part—starting.

DAY 2 – The “Automatic Habit” Lie
You didn’t smoke or vape because you loved it.
You did it because nicotine trained you to.
Your brain has patterns, not preferences.
Today, you start breaking those patterns.

DAY 3 – Cravings Are Not Commands
A craving is not a danger.
It’s a suggestion.
Suggestions can be ignored.
When cravings show up today, tell yourself:
“This will pass. It always does.”

Cravings peak fast and die fast.
Most last 2–5 minutes.
When one hits today, set a mental timer.
Breathe. Wait. You’ll see it fade.

DAY 5 – Coffee Trigger
If you usually smoke or vape with coffee, this is a danger zone.
Today, hold your cup with both hands.
Take 3 deep breaths.
Say: “The addiction doesn’t get my morning anymore.”

That’s just a loop you’ve repeated.
Today, stand up ASAP after meals.
Walk or move for 60 seconds. Break the loop.

One week without nicotine isn’t luck.
It’s discipline, awareness, and intelligence.
You are doing something powerful.
Be proud of yourself today.

DAY 8 – Identity Shift
Smokers crave. Non-smokers breathe.
Today, you are a non-smoker practicing breathing.
Each time you choose breath over nicotine, your identity shifts.

DAY 9 – Addiction Begs You Back
The addiction will whisper today:
“Just one.”
“You earned it.”
That voice isn’t you.
It’s the addiction begging for survival.

DAY 10 – Stress Without Nicotine
You never needed nicotine for stress.
Stress is part of life.
Nicotine just distracted you from it.
Today, when stressed, breathe instead of reaching for nicotine.

DAY 11 – The Craving Wave
Cravings act like waves.
They rise, peak, and fall.
Every time you ride one out without nicotine, you win.
Remember: it will pass.

DAY 12 – Driving Trigger

Today, if you get a craving while driving, turn off the radio for 60 seconds.
Breathe. Feel your hands on the wheel.
You’re in control.

DAY 13 – The Addiction Is Getting Weaker
Day by day, cravings become shorter and weaker.
You might not notice it yet, but your brain does.
Every day without nicotine is a punch to addiction’s power.

DAY 14 – Two Weeks Free
Two weeks is big.
Many never make it this far.
You did.
You are proving you are stronger than nicotine.

DAY 15 – End-of-Day Trigger
After work or at night, your brain may push for “one little hit.”
Today, before you go home, take 3 breaths.
Say: “I’m ending my day as a non-smoker.”

DAY 16 – Social Situations
You might feel cravings in social situations.
That’s not you wanting nicotine—that’s your brain expecting it.
Stay present. Talk. Laugh. Breathe.
You don’t need nicotine to belong.

DAY 17 – The Voice of Doubt
If you hear, “You can’t do this,” answer it:
“I already am.”
Doubt is normal.
Your actions are stronger than doubt.

DAY 18 – Nicotine Isn’t Relief
Nicotine causes the discomfort it claims to relieve.
Today, when you feel uneasy, remind yourself:
“Real relief comes from breathing and calm.”
Choose that.

DAY 19 – Breaking One Loop
Today, pick one trigger: coffee, driving, after meals, anything.
Plan to handle it differently.
When the moment comes, execute your plan.
You are rewriting your brain.

DAY 20 – Cravings Are Memories
At this point, many cravings are just memories.
Your body is already healing.
Your brain is just replaying old scenes.
Let the memory play without acting on it.

DAY 21 – Three Weeks
Three weeks without nicotine is massive.
Your lungs, your blood, your brain are all healing.
You may not see it every day, but your body knows.
You’re winning.

Protect it today.

DAY 24 – Craving Detective
Today, if a craving hits, ask yourself:
“What triggered this?”
Was it boredom? Stress? Coffee?
Every time you see the trigger, it loses power.

DAY 25 – Future You
Picture yourself 90 days from now:
Breathing easier. More energy. More money. More control.
Today is part of that future.
Keep going.

DAY 26 – Vaping Lies
If you used to vape, the addiction told you:
“It’s safer than smoking.”
But addiction is addiction.
Today, you are breaking the whole addiction, not just a form of it.

DAY 27 – Emotional Waves
Emotions will come and go.
Anger, sadness, boredom, stress.
You don’t smoke at emotions anymore.
You feel them and move through them.

DAY 28 – Four Weeks
Four weeks—an entire month without nicotine.
This is not an accident.
This is you, taking your life back.

DAY 29 – Notice the Wins
Today, look for one win:
Better breathing, less coughing, more stamina, more patience, anything.
Notice it.
You earned it.

When user logs a slip (“I smoked / vaped / used nicotine”):

Screen 1 – You Didn’t Fail
“You didn’t fail. You slipped.
This was one moment, not the whole story.
The important thing is: you came back. That means you’re winning.”

Button: Continue

Screen 2 – Understand What Happened
Ask:

“What triggered the slip?”

Stress / Boredom / Social / Driving / After a meal / Alcohol / Habit / Other

“How did you feel right before?”

Stressed / Anxious / Restless / Emotional / Calm (automatic) / Other

“How do you feel now?”

Disappointed / Angry / Neutral / Determined / Ready to restart

Update trigger data.

Screen 3 – Reframe
“If you slipped, it means your addiction saw an opening.
It does NOT mean you failed.
It does NOT mean you can’t quit.
It means your addiction is fighting to survive—and you caught it.
You’re stronger now than before the slip.”

Button: I’m Ready to Get Back on Track

Quick-Recovery Plan (24 hours)
Steps:

Drink a glass of water

Breathe for 60 seconds

Identify the trigger that led to the slip

Commit to being nicotine-free for the rest of today

No “Day 1” reset. Instead:

Show “Nicotine-free days: X”

Show “Recent slips: Y”

Emphasize momentum, not perfection.

9. REWARD MILESTONES SYSTEM
Milestones at:

1, 3, 6, 12, 24 hours

Day 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 10

Days 14, 21, 30, 45, 60

Days 90, 120, 150, 180, 240, 300, 365

Each milestone:

Unlocks a badge

Shows a celebration screen

Sends a push notification

Optionally shows a health benefit estimate

Sample badges:

Hour One Hero

Craving Crusher

Day One Warrior

One Week Warrior

One Month Free Human

90-Day Freedom Level

Six-Month Warrior

One Year Free Human

No punishment if they slip—badges remain, maybe marked “Rebuilding” until new streak.

10. CALCULATOR LOGIC
Inputs per user (examples):

cigarettes_per_day

cigarettes_per_pack (default 20)

pack_price

avg_minutes_per_cigarette (default 5)

vape_daily_spend

vape_sessions_per_day (optional)

avg_minutes_per_vape_session

pouches_per_day

pouches_per_can (default 20)

pouch_can_price

avg_minutes_per_pouch

cans_per_week (dip)

dip_can_price

dip_sessions_per_day

avg_minutes_per_dip_session

Cost Calculations
Cigarettes:

packs_per_day = cigarettes_per_day / cigarettes_per_pack

cig_daily_cost = packs_per_day * pack_price

cig_monthly_cost = cig_daily_cost * 30

cig_yearly_cost = cig_daily_cost * 365

cig_5yr_cost = cig_yearly_cost * 5

Similar for vape, pouches, dip using daily or weekly spend.

Time Spent
Cigarettes:

cig_minutes_per_day = cigarettes_per_day * avg_minutes_per_cigarette

cig_hours_per_day = cig_minutes_per_day / 60

cig_hours_per_year = cig_hours_per_day * 365

cig_days_per_year = cig_hours_per_year / 24

Apply same pattern to vape, pouches, dip.

Mixed Use
Sum costs and time across product types:

total_daily_cost

total_monthly_cost

total_yearly_cost

total_5yr_cost

total_minutes_per_day → hours → days per year

Since Quit
days_since_quit = (now - quit_datetime) in days

money_saved = total_daily_cost * days_since_quit

units_avoided per product: usage_per_day * days_since_quit

minutes_freed = total_minutes_per_day * days_since_quit

Optional life-days regained estimate based on a simple constant.

11. EMERGENCY HELP SECTION
For intense cravings or panic:

Provide:

5-minute breathing exercises

“Urge surfing” guidance

Short reality checks:

“You’re not craving. Your addiction is.”

“This will pass in a few minutes.”

Throughout the day: trigger-based notifications and lessons

Track cravings, triggers, slips, wins

Evening: close the day with a success message, even if imperfect

Relapse:

Never reset to “Day 1”

Never shame

Always reframe and re-engage

Goal:

Educate → build awareness → control triggers → commit one day at a time → track progress → celebrate milestones → support slips without shame → create a permanent non-smoker identity.
